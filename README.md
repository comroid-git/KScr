# KScr.NET
A simple interpreter that attempts to grow into an object oriented language (eventually)

Working Code Example Files:
- [x] `HelloWorld.kscr`
- [x] `PrintNumbers.kscr`
- [x] `MathFromIO.kscr`
- [ ] `ToStringTest.kscr` (requires objects)
- [ ] `File.kscr` (core class; requires native class members)
- [ ] `FileIO.kscr` (requires File core class)
- [ ] `Function.kscr`

All files need to be resolved before being able to compile the core module.
